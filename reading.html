  <h1>Sand_ DEVIL's POOL</h1>
  <h2>GEORGE SAND</h2>
  <h3>*Holbein the Younger</h3>
  <p>born in German, one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century.<br>
  invoke death as the punishment of injustice and the guerdon of suffering
  The author sees and tries to depict what the simple and rustic ideal world is like through appreciating the pictures of Holbein.
  the peasant doesn't feel like they are happy while they have the close touch with the field, sky and meadow. 
  In fact, they have a life of toil and all they got cannot even satisfy what their basic need.

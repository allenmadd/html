      I missed one day. But I think it was fine. I just survived from my mid-term exam. Althought it seems inappropriate to use the word"survive", the exam itself is not hard at all. But some questions are really tricky. What can I say ? <br>
      Our professor does like others to listen to his boring lecture, I mean, it's too easy and whatever he is trying to do makes nonsense to me.<br>
      Tomorrow I will begin my two days' journey of los angles, exciting event,doesn't it? Hope I could find more friends there.<br>
      Oh, I almost forgot the most astonishing news these days, the AI alphaGo Zero comes out of nowhere, with no human knowledge, for only three days, it beats the master, who has beaten all human beings with 60 vesus 0. Notice that there is no human knowledge as input, all it did was to play with himself. What the hack! I feel like I have seen iceberg of the new world.

      Lucky day I guess. Something is wrong with the program when I take part in the psychological experiment, which makes me catch up with my economic lecture. But I do know that I have just lost another big opportunity, fixing the bug and make myself reputational. So sad I don't think I have the tech to fix that problem.<br>

      I kind of missed my life and my friends in the past after listening to some TouHou Project music. What a life! Suddenly I have a feeling that I have never experienced and I cannot express it. Homesickness, maybe, but not exactly. I try to get rid of this feeling as it makes me immerse into the momery, which interferes my work. But maybe it is a good idea to rethink about it later when I am free. Unbelievable feeling!
